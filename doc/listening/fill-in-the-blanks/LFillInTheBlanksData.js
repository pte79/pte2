The Hansa merchant bought shiploads of <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank1"> <span class='answer hidden'>salted</span> fish and in return the islanders got cash, grain, cloth and other goods. This lasted until the Act of Union between Scotland and England in 1707. This Act prohibited the Hansa merchant from <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank2"> <span class='answer hidden'>trading</span> with Scotland. Consequently Shetland went into an economic <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank3"> <span class='answer hidden'>depression</span>. The independent farmers of Shetland had to sell their land and were then <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank4"> <span class='answer hidden'>obligated</span> to pay rent, eventually becoming serfs.`,

    transcript: `Numbers and diagrams are highly abstract and condensed summaries of the world. They require a degree of mental effort to <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank0"> <span class='answer hidden'>bridge</span> the gap between them and the aspects of the ‘real’ world they stand for. Approach them slowly and with care, allowing yourself time to get the feel of what you are looking at. Don't <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank1"> <span class='answer hidden'>assume</span> you already know what you are looking at?
