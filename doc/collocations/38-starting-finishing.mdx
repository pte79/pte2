## Story

Let’s get started with a common question: is there a difference between the verbs “start” and “begin”? There’s no difference in meaning – “I started studying English 3 years ago” is the same as “I began studying English 3 years ago” – but “begin” is a little more formal than “start.”

The phrase **“let’s get started”** s an informal way to announce the beginning of an activity. You can also say that something **“got off to a good start”** if it began well. Other collocations for a good start include an **encouraging start** or **promising start** – these expressions show that there is hope for good results in the future. For example, “The soccer team got off to a promising start, winning the first four games of the season.”

If it is not so certain that there will be good results in the future, then you can say a **shaky start** or **unsteady start –** “The business had a **shaky start** in the second quarter of 2013, with sales numbers fluctuating daily.”

If the beginning of something did not meet expectations, you can call it a **disappointing start** – and if it was REALLY terrible, you can describe it as a **disastrous start.** “Kevin failed every single one of his first exams – his semester was off to a **disastrous start.”**

Sometimes things go so badly that you need to get out of the situation and have a completely **fresh start** or **new beginning.** When a successful person or company started without being famous or rich, then we say they had a **humble/modest beginning.**

Now let’s talk about “finish” and “end” – there is a difference between these two verbs. “Finish” usually implies *completing*something, whereas “end” is used for a more passive situation/state:

- I **finished** my homework.
- The semester **ends** in December.
- We need to **finish** the project.
- We **ended** our partnership with that company.

When you make the final changes to something before it is completed, we say you **put the finishing touches on it.**

Two expressions used to talk about ending something are **come to an end** or **draw to a close.** You can also say **“the beginning of the end”** to describe something that will probably end soon – “The explosion at the factory was the beginning of the end for our company.” In other words, the explosion began a process of the company failing and eventually shutting down.

When something ends quickly, then it comes to an **abrupt/sudden end.** On the other hand, when an activity appears that it will continue forever, then we say there’s **no end in sight.**
