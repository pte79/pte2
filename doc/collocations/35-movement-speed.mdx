## Story

English has a number of words that mean _**“fast”**_ – but each one has different collocations.

Use **fast** to describe a vehicle, person, or action: a **fast car, a fast train, a fast runner, work fast, drive fast, learn fast**.

Use **quick** to describe an event or action: **a quick lunch, a quick glance, a quick shower, a quick decision**.

Use **rapid** to describe a change: **a rapid increase/decline, a rapid change, rapid growth, rapid progress**.

The word **speedy** is often used with **recovery** and **resolution:** a **speedy recovery** from surgery, a **speedy resolution** to the problem.

The word **swift** is often used with **action, response,** and **reaction:** The **swift action** of the police enabled the criminal to be caught immediately; we received a **swift response** to our request for information.

The word **prompt** means “_fast and punctual”_ – it is often used with information and payment or customer service. For example, you can give a **prompt reply** to an e-mail, and receive **prompt delivery** of a product you ordered.

The word **hasty** means _“fast and in a rush”_ – He made a **hasty exit** from the party when he saw his ex-girlfriend walk in. This word often has connotation of doing something without sufficient consideration. You might come to a **hasty conclusion** before considering all the evidence, and make a **hasty decision** that you’ll regret later.

When you’re driving, you need to pay attention to the **speed limit** – the maximum velocity permitted. If you’re driving **at breakneck speed** _(extremely fast)_, then you might need to slow down. If you get caught in a **speed trap** _(where the police measure the velocity of passing cars),_ you might have to pay a **speeding ticket** _(penalty for driving too fast)._

Of course, you might need to put on a **burst of speed** *(sudden increase in speed)*t o pass a car that’s **moving at a snail’s pace** _(very slowly)._ If major construction is being done on the road, then traffic might **slow to a crawl** *(slow down to a very slow speed)*and eventually **come to a standstill** _(stop completely)._ To talk about changes in speed, we can say something is **gaining speed** or **speeding up** _(to describe moving faster)_ or **losing speed** or **slowing down** _(to describe moving slower)._

Finally, to talk about eating or walking in a slow and relaxed way, you can use the word “leisurely” – After a **leisurely breakfast,** we took a **leisurely stroll** through the park.
