## Story

There are a number of **lifestyle changes** you can make to improve your **overall health**and increase your **life expectancy** _(how long you are expected to live)_ – you can **quit smoking, reduce stress, eat a balanced diet, get plenty of sleep,** and **exercise regularly.** It’s also important to **get vaccinations/immunizations** to prevent diseases. No matter how healthy you are, it’s still a good idea to have **health insurance** – a program/plan to cover expenses in case of an accident or serious illness.

If you’re in a car accident, you might **suffer/sustain serious injuries.** Of course, if you’re wearing your seatbelt, you’re more likely to have only **minor injuries.** If you’ve **broken/fractured a bone –** for example, your leg – the doctor will **put your leg in a cast.** If you have a cut, the doctor will **give you stitches.** If you have a burn, the doctor will give you an ointment to **prevent infection.**

If you have a **minor ailment** like a headache, you can **take some aspirin** to **relieve the pain** _(reduce the effects of the pain)_. If you **suffer from a chronic condition** _(a condition that continues for a long time)_ like allergies, asthma, back pain, or depression, there are both **over-the counter** and **prescription medications** that can help **alleviate the symptoms** _(an over-the-counter medication is one that you can buy without a doctor’s prescription)._

When someone has a minor respiratory infection, we say they **have a cold.** Don’t get too close to that person, because you could **catch a cold,** too! You can “catch” other types of contagious diseases as well – such as **sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs).**

If someone **is diagnosed with** a more serious illness such as cancer or AIDS, they’ll need more extensive treatment. When a disease has progressed so far that it will be impossible to cure, then the patient is said to be **terminally ill** – in other words, the person will definitely die of the disease soon.
