## Story

Most children begin their studies at 5 or 6 years old in **pre-school,** followed by **kindergarten.** After that comes **primary/elementary school,** which consists of **first grade** through **fifth grade.** Then there’s **middle school – sixth grade** through **eighth grade – ** and **high school,** which is **ninth grade** through **twelfth grade.**

After high school, you **apply to colleges/universities** to see which ones will accept you. You **send in/submit your application** and then wait for the results. If you **got good grades** in high school, you might **get / be awarded a scholarship** to help pay the tuition (the cost of studying).

In college, you’ll **take classes/courses** on various subjects. You should always **take notes** as the teacher is **giving the lecture.** Some teachers may ask the students to **give/make presentations** or **do research** and **write an essay, an assignment, a report,** or **a paper.** After you **hand in your work,** the teacher will **grade the assignment** _(give you an evaluation, for example, 90%)_ and **give you feedback** _(comments on your work)_.

To evaluate your progress, you’ll **take tests/exams.** If you get the minimum number of points required, you’ve **passed the test;** if you don’t get the minimum number of points, you’ve **failed the test.** It’s also possible to **pass/fail a course.**

If the course proves to be too difficult, or if you don’t like it, you can **withdraw from** or **drop the course.** “Withdraw from” is the more formal expression, and “drop” is the more informal expression.

Most college students **choose a major/concentration.** To talk about a concentration of studies, you can use “major” as a verb or a noun – for example,

_“I majored in biology” / “I was a biology major.”_

_“My daughter is majoring in philosophy.” / “My daughter’s a philosophy major.”_

When you **graduate from college,** you’ll **get a diploma.** Afterwards, you can say you **have a degree**in the area of your concentration. You can have a **bachelor’s degree, master’s degree,** or **doctorate (Ph.D.),** for example:

_“I have a bachelor’s degree in chemistry.”_

_“I have a master’s degree in linguistics.”_

_“I have a Ph.D. in theology.”_
