# 47. Praising & Criticizing

## Story

When I told my family I wanted to be a professional musician, I faced a **barrage of criticism** _(intense attack of negative comments)_ from my parents, who **strongly disapproved** of the idea. I’d had a feeling that they would only **give their blessing** _(give their approval/support)_ to a more “traditional” career track.

I **countered their criticism** _(argued against their criticism)_ by pointing out that I’d rather follow my passion and enjoy my job than get rich working a job I hated. Although they gave their **grudging approval** _(angry and reluctant approval)_ to my enrollment in music school, I could tell by my father’s **frown of disapproval** _(disapproving facial expression)_ that he wished I’d study law or medicine instead.

The only person who encouraged me was my aunt, who **thinks the world of me** _(has great respect and admiration for me)_ and has always offered **enthusiastic support** for my hopes and dreams. She **heartily approved** _(completely and sincerely approved)_ of my plans and **dismissed** my parents’ **criticisms** as ridiculous.

My parents finally came around when I gave my first concert in Carnegie Hall, to a **standing ovation** _(when the audience stands up and claps for an extended period of time)_. The critics had given my show **rave reviews** _(extremely positive evaluations)_, describing it as **an outstanding performance** _(an excellent, superior performance)_.

After seeing me on stage, my parents **congratulated me warmly** _(congratulated me with love)_ and apologized for the **scathing criticisms** _(very strong and hurtful criticisms)_ they had made in the past. Later, I heard them **speaking highly of** _(saying good things about)_ my music to some of their friends. I had finally **won their approval**.
