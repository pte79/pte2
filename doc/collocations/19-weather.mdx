## Story

Do you want to know if it’ll be sunny or rainy next weekend? Then you should check the **weather forecast** – that’s the prediction of the weather in the near future.
If the forecast says **the sun will be shining brightly,** with **clear skies** _(no clouds in the sky)_ and **high temperatures,** then it’s a good day to go to the beach and **bask in the sunshine** (or **soak up the sunshine**) – these expressions mean to enjoy the sun’s heat and light.

However, if the forecast says it’ll be **oppressively hot, scorching hot,** or **swelteringly hot**, then you might want to stay inside and turn up the air conditioning! Another common phrase is **hot and humid** – that means hot with a lot of water in the air (so you will sweat a lot).

The weather forecast might say it will be **partly cloudy** _(the sky partially covered by clouds)._ Another way to say this is that there are **scattered clouds** _(just a few clouds)._ If there are **heavy clouds**, then you won’t be able to see the sun at all – and if there are **storm clouds,** then it will probably rain very soon. One way to express this is to say **“It looks like rain.”**
We can have **light rain** _(little rain)_ or **heavy rain** _(lots of rain, intense rain)_ – and if the rain gets REALLY intense, we can describe it as **torrential rain.** If the rain continues without stopping, then we call it **continuous rain** or **constant rain** – but if it’s the type of rain that starts and stops various times throughout the day, it’s called **intermittent rain** or **scattered showers.** When it stops raining, you can say **the rain let up.**

Rain is usually accompanied by wind, which can be **light/slight winds** or **high/strong winds.** If the wind is especially strong and violent, you can say **fierce winds** or **gale-force winds** – this last expression is usually used for winds at the level of a hurricane. When the wind is increasing in intensity, we say **“The wind is picking up,”** and when it is decreasing in intensity, we say **“The wind is dying down.”**
Sometimes we describe the wind with an adjective that emphasizes the cold – such as **a biting wind**or ** an icy wind.** Finally, a sudden instance of wind can be called a **blast of wind** or a **gust of wind.**

Snow, like rain, can be light or heavy. Light snow can also be called **snow flurries.** When the snow is being blown around in the wind, we can describe it as **driving snow** or **swirling snow.** It can be wonderful to walk through **fresh, powdery, newly fallen snow** – but not so nice to drive on it. So we **clear the snow** or **plough the snow** with vehicles to remove it from the roads. You can also do this manually – that’s called **shoveling the snow.** At the end of winter, when temperatures rise, the **snow melts** – it turns into water and disappears.

Sometimes the weather is unusual for a particular time of year. For example, in the winter, you might have a day that is **unseasonably warm,** and in the summer, you might have a day that is **unseasonably cool.** When the temperature reaches an extreme, we call that a **record high** or a **record low**.

Here are some alternative ways of saying the weather was good. You can say the weather was **beautiful, lovely, ideal, superb,** or **perfect.** To say the weather was bad, you can say the weather was **lousy, miserable, nasty, dreadful,** or **terrible.**

Other ways to describe the weather:

- **gloomy/dismal weather** = weather that is dark, rather rainy, and depressing

- **muggy/sultry weather** = weather that is very hot and humid or wet

- **mild / calm weather** = weather that is nice and not extreme

- **harsh/severe/wild weather** = weather that is extreme and violent
