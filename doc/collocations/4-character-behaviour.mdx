# 4. Character and Behaviour

<Image src={characterBehaviourImg} alt="character and behaviour" />

## Story

When I was a teenager, I was **painfully shy** _(extremely shy)_. I loved reading books, and I **had a vivid imagination** _(had a creative and colorful imagination)_. My best friend had a more **outgoing personality** _(she liked to be friendly and sociable)_ and a good **sense of humor** _(ability to make other people laugh)_. Unfortunately she was also **brutally honest**, and sometimes her comments **hurt my feelings** _(made me sad, upset, or angry)_.

Although I was **fiercely loyal** to her, she **showed her true colors** _(revealed her true personality)_ when she **played a prank** _(did a trick)_ that humiliated me in front of the class. I **bore a grudge** _(continued feeling angry)_ against her for years afterwards. Now that I look back on it, I can see that she had **low self-esteem** _(she considered herself inferior)_ and a bit of **a mean streak** _(a “streak” is a tiny bit of someone’s personality)_.

I’ve **come out of my shell** _(become less shy)_ since those days; I **have a thicker skin** _(I’m less sensitive to criticism)_ and it doesn’t bother me when people **speak their minds** _(say exactly what they think, without considering the effects of the words on others)_.

My biggest flaw is that I **have a tendency** to be arrogant – some say I **have a superiority complex** _(consider myself superior to others)_. I’ll admit that it is hard for me to **swallow my pride** _(stop being arrogant)_ and recognize when I’ve been mistaken about something. My resolution for the New Year is to make a more concerted effort to **put others first** _(consider the needs of other people more important than my own)._
