## Story

If you’ve just graduated from college and you’ve never had a job, you can start your career by **doing an internship** _(a temporary, low-level job)_ to gain experience. Depending on the company, the internship could lead to an opportunity to get an **entry-level job** *(a job that doesn’t require much skill or experience)*at the same company.
Although you might be earning **minimum wage** _(the minimum salary required by law)_, if you do excellent work and are **a good team player** _(you cooperate well with your co-workers)_ you could **get a promotion** _(get an increase in responsibility)_ or **get a raise** _(get an increase in salary)_ – hopefully both! Just don’t slack off, otherwise you’ll **be fired/dismissed** _(lose your job)._

It’s normal for there to be periods of time when you have **a heavy workload** _(a lot of work)_ and need to **work overtime** _(work extra hours)_. But if you have a very **demanding job** _(an intense job with lots of responsibilities)_ and you’re stressed out all the time, then it might be time to **quit your job** _(leave your job voluntarily)_ and look for another one.

Now that you have experience, you’ll be able to **get a job** with a more **competitive salary** _(salary that is higher than average)_ and **generous benefits** _(extra benefits like health insurance, discounts, a company car, etc)_. If you can’t find a **well-paid** and **rewarding job** in your field, it might be time for a **career change.**
The typical way of **applying for a job** is to read the **job ads** in the newspaper or online, then send your resume to the company with a cover letter. The company will then **interview the candidates** it feels are most qualified, based on the **job description.**

Sometimes **job seekers** _(people looking for a job)_ need to take a **menial job** _(job requiring a very low level of skill)_ in order to **earn a living** _(get enough money to survive)_ while they’re **between jobs.** But if you’re persistent, **a great job offer** should come your way sooner or later – maybe even for your **dream job** _(a job that would be perfect for you)_ !

**Melissa:** Hi Terry, let’s go over the list of people who have <input className="input small-input"/> for the job.

**Terry:** Sure. There’s Bob, who’s fresh out of college and says this would be his “<input className="input small-input"/> job.”

**Melissa:** Although I admire his enthusiasm, this isn’t an <input className="input small-input"/> job - we really need someone with a bit of experience.

**Terry:** Here’s a resume from Dana - she’s a freelance writer who’s looking for a more stable way to earn a <input className="input small-input"/>. Unfortunately, she mentions in her cover letter that she’s not willing to work <input className="input small-input"/> because she has two small kids at home.

**Melissa:** Hmm… this is a rather <input className="input small-input"/> job and sometimes we do need to work late. Let’s not rule her out, though. Who else is in the running?

**Terry:** There’s Steven, a veteran reporter who’s currently <input className="input small-input"/> jobs. He makes it clear in his cover letter that he expects a <input className="input small-input"/> salary and <input className="input small-input"/> benefits.

**Melissa:** He might be worth it. Why did he leave his last job?

**Terry:** Um, well, I checked his references and it turns out he was <input className="input small-input"/> for sexual harassment of a co-worker.

**Melissa:** Oh… that’s not ideal. Do we have any other <input className="input small-input"/>?

**Terry:** None who are particularly qualified - there’s a marketing consultant looking for a <input className="input small-input"/> change, and a few people who apparently didn’t read the job <input className="input small-input"/> and sent us generic letters.

**Melissa:** Maybe we could <input className="input small-input"/> Dana the job, and if it’s too much work for her to handle, we could have Bob do an <input className="input small-input"/> to help her out. We could only afford to pay him <input className="input small-input"/> wage, but he might find the experience <input className="input small-input"/>.

**Terry:** OK – let’s <input className="input small-input"/> both of them next week.
