## Story

Are you always **in a rush,** or do you **take your time?** Do you **spend your time** efficiently, or do you **waste time** and procrastinate important tasks – then stay up working until **ungodly hours** _(very late at night/early in the morning)_?

It has **taken me ages** _(taken a very long time)_, but I’ve finally adopted some **time-management** habits:

- Plan things **well in advance** and don’t underestimate the **amount of time** things will take – otherwise you’ll end up being a slave to your **grueling schedule** _(very intense schedule)._

- Take care of **time-consuming tasks** *(things that take a lot of time)*on a day when you have no **pressing commitments** _(urgent appointments or things to do)._

- **Establish a timeline** for major projects, so that you don’t **leave things to the last minute** and risk **running out of time.** Then, **stick to the schedule** and try to **get ahead** if possible. There’s nothing worse than **falling behind** on a project with a **strict deadline** _(a definite date before which it needs to be finished)._

- Leave home and work a little earlier than normal to avoid **rush hour** _(the time when there is a lot of traffic because everyone is going to work or coming home from work)._
- Sleep for **eight solid hours** _(eight hours without interruption)_ every night; you’ll wake up with more energy.

If you’re working **from dawn till dusk** _(from the early morning to the late evening)_ and you have little or no **spare/free time,** it could mean that you’re overworked, and you should **cut back on your hours** _(reduce your working hours)_ to **free up some time** _(make more time available)._
