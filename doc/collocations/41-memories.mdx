## Story

I’m trying to think of my earliest memory. I **vaguely remember** _(remember a little bit, not in much detail)_ when my brother was born – I was three years old at the time – but I **distinctly remember** my first day of kindergarten, when I was around five.

When I look at photos, even more **memories come flooding back** _(memories come to mind)_ – I remember my school, my classmates, and my teacher, who would **constantly remind** us to clean up the classroom, because we were always making a mess. I’d **completely forgotten** the teacher’s name, though, and my mother had to **refresh my memory** _(remind me of a fact I’d forgotten)._

I still have a lot of my toys from when I was a kid. They **bring back fond memories** _(pleasant memories)_ of long afternoons spent playing with my brother. I also remember a family vacation to Switzerland when I was about eight – that was an **unforgettable experience.**

My most **traumatic memory** is of my uncle dying in a car crash when I was ten. He was only 32 years old – younger than my dad – and the **memory** of the funeral still **haunts** me _(the sad/profound memory stays with me)_. I still wear a bracelet that was a Christmas present from him; it **serves as a sobering reminder** _(it provides a serious reminder)_ not to take a single day of life for granted.

Unfortunately, I have a **terrible memory** for peoples’ names, unless the name is unusual or **particularly memorable.** Just the other day, I was talking to an acquaintance from church and **my mind went blank** _(I couldn’t think of anything)_ when I tried to think of her name. **I racked my brain** _(tried hard to remember something)_, but nothing **came to mind.** My husband **gently reminds me** that I really need to pay more attention, because it **makes a bad impression** when I call people by the wrong name.
