## Story

I experienced a **roller coaster of emotions** when my son was born _(many different emotions one after another)_. During my wife’s pregnancy, I was **ridiculously excited** about the prospect of becoming a dad. On the big day, I’d imagined that everything would go smoothly and we’d be **blissfully happy –** but there were complications during the delivery and my wife had to have emergency surgery while I waited in the reception area, **worried sick** _(very worried)._

As time went by, I got **increasingly anxious** because the doctors weren’t telling me anything. After two hours I was **seething with anger** *(ready to explode with anger),*and I and shouted at one of the nurses. Then the security guards came and escorted me out of the hospital.

My wife was **visibly disappointed** _(it was obvious that she was disappointed)_ that I wasn’t by her side when she woke up from surgery. She didn’t say anything – she’s not really one to **show her feelings;** she prefers to **bottle up her emotions** _(keep her emotions hidden inside her)_– but I knew I had let her down and I was **terribly sorry** that I had **lost my temper** _(lost control and shown anger)._

The months that followed were tough. My wife became **deeply depressed,** and I too was an **emotional wreck** _(a person who is very sad, confused, and upset)_ as I tried to juggle the demands of work and family life. But now things are starting to turn around – I’ve been **pleasantly surprised** at the all help we’ve gotten from our friends and neighbors.

I’m just **immensely grateful** that my wife and son are healthy, and sometimes I’m **overwhelmed with emotion** as I reflect on how lucky we are _(when emotion is so strong that it’s difficult to think or speak)._
