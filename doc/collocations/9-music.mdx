# 9. Music

## Story

My older brother Alex is very **musically gifted** _(he has a natural talent for music)_. He can play any tune from memory, without looking at **sheet music** _(musical notation written on paper)._ He spends all his free time **strumming a guitar** _(playing a guitar),_ **composing music** _(creating music),_ and writing **song lyrics** _(the words to a song)._

Alex and his friends formed a band that has attracted **a sizable following** _(a lot of fans)_ in our city. They started out **playing gigs** _(giving small, informal performances)_ in bars and clubs, and they used the money they earned to **record their debut album** _(record their first CD)._

**A remixed track** _(a song that has been modified electronically)_ from that CD then became **a massive hit** *(a very popular song)*on the local radio station thanks to its **catchy tune** _(memorable melody)_ and **upbeat tempo** _(fast rhythm)._

Their second **album will be released** _(it will be made available to the public)_ at the end of the year; they’ll **record it live** at their next show. Alex dreams of **going on tour** – he’s just waiting for his **big break** _(big opportunity to become famous)_ to get his foot in the door of the **music industry.**

As for me, I love **singing along** _(singing together)_ to my brother’s music, but a career in music isn’t for me – I’m **completely tone-deaf** _(unable to correctly identify different musical notes)_ and I always **sing off-key** _(sing the incorrect melody)!_
