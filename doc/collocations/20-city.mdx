# 20. City

## Story

When my parents retired last year, they traded the **towering skyscrapers** _(very tall buildings)_ and **noise pollution** _(excessive noise)_ of Los Angeles for the peace and quiet of a small **coastal city** _(a city near the ocean)_ in southern France. They said they were tired of living in a **high-rise building** right next to an **industrial zone.** Now they live in a **cozy little house** on **the outskirts of the city** _(on the outer edge of the city, not in the center)._

Life in their new town is quite different from the **hectic pace** _(the fast and chaotic rhythm)_ of L.A., where the **bustling streets** _(busy streets filled with people)_ are **strewn with litter** _(filled with garbage)_ and you can count on spending hours in **traffic jams** _(stopped traffic)_.

Instead, the **narrow cobblestone streets** of the city center are lined with **eighteenth-century buildings** that are now home to **quaint shops** *(charming and old-fashioned shops) *and **gourmet restaurants** specializing in the **local cuisine** _(the typical food of the region)._

The best day to visit is Saturday, when there’s an **open-air market** _(an outdoor market)_ in the **main square.** You can buy souvenirs from the **street vendors** _(people selling things on the street)_ and have lunch at one of the **trendy cafés** _(modern, stylish, and popular cafés)_ in the area. There’s virtually no **street crime** here, in contrast to the **inner-city areas** _(older, central, crowded part of a city, usually filled with poor people and possibly violence)_ of L.A.

Is there anything that my parents miss about Los Angeles? Well, they do miss the **cultural diversity.** But they’re past the age where being in a place with a **pulsating nightlife** _(having many exciting bars and clubs)_ is important to them.
