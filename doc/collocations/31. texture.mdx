## Story

The word _“texture”_ refers to the way something feels, and there are many different collocations used to describe it. Let’s look at them in pairs of opposites.

- **Dry hair / Oily or greasy hair** – You need to wash oily hair more often than you need to wash dry hair.

- **Dry skin / Oily skin** – Oily skin is prone to acne, whereas dry skin often needs moisturizer.

- **A Smooth / Rough surface** – Surfaces such as the ground, a road, and your skin can be smooth (with a consistent surface) or rough (with a varied surface).

- **Calm / Choppy or rough water** – The water of the ocean is calm when the weather is mild, and it is choppy/rough when there are high winds.

- **Hard / Soft object –** A mattress or pillow, for example, can be hard or soft.

- **Tender / Tough meat** – Meat that is _“tender”_ is easy to cut and chew, and meat that is _“tough”_ is difficult to cut and chew.

- **A Sharp / Dull blade or point** – A knife or a pencil can be _“sharp”_ – meaning it can cut – or _“dull”_, meaning it has lost its ability to cut.

The verbs _“soften”_ and _“harden”_ describe the process of becoming soft and becoming hard. For example, **potatoes soften** when you cook them in boiling water. And **snow hardens** if the temperature decreases and the snow begins turning into ice.

We can also use “_soften_” and “_harden_” in a more metaphorical way – we can say a person’s **voice softens** when they begin speaking in a more friendly tone, and their **voice hardens** when they begin speaking in a less friendly tone. A person’s attitude or views can also “_soften_” (become more friendly/tolerant) or “_harden_” (become less friendly/less tolerant).

Texture words are often used when describing food:

- **creamy -** describes a smooth and rich texture, like cream. Sauces, soups, puddings, and chocolate can be **creamy.**

- **crunchy/crispy –** describe something that makes a noise when you chew it. Crackers, chips, bacon, granola, and other “hard” foods can be **crunchy** or **crispy.**

- **chewy** – describes food that requires some effort to chew. Caramels and other types of candy can be **chewy.** This word can have a negative connotation if the food is not *supposed*to be chewy – for example, when you overcook meat, it becomes **tough** and **chewy.**

- **greasy –** describes food with a lot of oil. Hamburgers, French fries, and chicken wings can be **greasy.**
