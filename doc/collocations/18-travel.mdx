## Story

Last week I had the worst **business trip** I’ve ever taken. Normally a **travel agency** takes care of **booking my flight** _(buying a plane ticket)_ and **making my hotel reservation,** but this time I decided make the **travel arrangements** myself. Big mistake!

First of all, **the plane was overbooked** _(there were more passengers than seats available)_ so **I was bumped to a later flight.** When they gave me my new **boarding pass** _(the ticket that allows you to enter the airplane)_, **they didn’t ask me if I’d prefer a **window seat** or an **aisle seat** _(a seat next to the corridor)_ – and I was stuck in the middle. To top it off, it was a very **bumpy flight\*\* _(a flight with a lot of turbulence)._

I then missed my **connecting flight** and had a **ten-hour layover** _(I had to wait ten hours for my next flight)_ in Chicago. Unfortunately, my **checked luggage** _(the bags in the airplane’s cargo compartment)_ had already gone through to my final destination, so all I had was my **carry-on bag** _(the bag you take with you on the plane)_. I **checked into a hotel** near the airport just so I could take a nap.

When I finally arrived in Los Angeles, it turns out that I had made a mistake with my hotel reservation, and instead of booking a room at **a five-star hotel,** I had booked three nights at **a seedy hotel** _(a hotel that is not very safe or comfortable)_ in **the red-light district** _(an area of the city where there are many sex shops, strip clubs, etc.)_! So I was stuck sleeping on an uncomfortable mattress in **a dingy room** _(a dirty and dark room)_ while my colleagues enjoyed the **luxury hotel.**

The trip home was uneventful, but when I arrived I discovered that the airline had **lost my luggage.** All in all it was a miserable experience.
