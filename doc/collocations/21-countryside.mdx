## Story

If you’re living in an urban area and looking for a little **change of scenery,** why not take a weekend trip to the **surrounding countryside**? You can walk through the **wildlife preserve** _(special area where animals are protected)_, where a **winding footpath** _(a road you can walk on, that has many turns and changes of direction)_ will lead you through **varied landscapes** including **dense forests, vast meadows,** and **gentle, rolling hills.**

More adventurous visitors will enjoy exploring the **rocky landscape** of Yosemite National Park with its **towering cliffs** _(very tall cliffs)_ and **magnificent waterfalls**. You can take a **hiking trail** that goes up the **steepest face of the tallest mountain** in the park _(the side of a mountain is called a “face” – and “steep” means it is very vertical)_. The trail starts at the **foot of the mountain** _(the base of the mountain)_ and the ascent takes about four hours; you can stop to have lunch on the banks of a **clear, bubbling mountain stream.**

From the summit, there’s a **spectacular panoramic view** _(meaning you can see in all directions)_ of the area. To the East, you can see the **jagged, snow-covered peaks** of a **distant mountain range** _(a group or chain of mountains)_; you can gaze at the **lush green countryside** _(an area with lots of healthy vegetation)_ to the south, and when looking west, you can see the **slow-moving, shallow river** _(a river that is not very deep or fast)_ that flows lazily towards the oceans.

The coastline is just a three-hour drive from the mountains, with miles of **sun-drenched, sandy beaches**. You can stay overnight at a family-run hotel in the **picturesque fishing village** _(beautiful, good for taking pictures)_, where every room has an **unobstructed view** _(there are no obstacles blocking the view)_ of the sea. The beaches tend to get crowded in the summer, so one option is to take a **boat trip** across the bay and explore the **secluded beaches** _(beaches that are hidden)_ on the island – **it’s well worth the trip** _(meaning it’s a good use of your time to go there)._
