## Story

We’ve already looked at a few pairs of confusing words, like end and finish, big and large, or fast and quick. Here are some additional verbs that are frequently confused by English learners, with their different collocations explained.

### close / shut

Close and shut are the same for doors, windows, mouths, and eyes.

- **Close the door / Shut the door** so that the mosquitoes don’t get in.
- It’s cold in here; could you please **close the window / shut the window**?
- She **shut her eyes / closed her eyes** as she began to meditate.
- Dan’s **mouth was closed / shut.**

**Note:** The word “shut” can be used with a word that implies the action was noisy:

- She **slammed** the door shut.
- The wind made the gate **bang** shut.

**Note:** The phrase “Shut your mouth!” is a rude way to tell somebody to stop talking.

- **Close** (not shut) is used for shops, banks, etc. as well as for airports and roads that are not open or available at a particular time:
- What time does the bank **close**?
- The roads are **closed** due to construction.
- The shop is **closing** in 30 minutes.

We use expressions with “close” to refer to the end of an event or process:

- Let’s **bring** this meeting **to a close.**
- It appears that the economic crisis is **drawing to a close / coming to a close**.
- Messi scored a goal in the **closing moments** of the game.

### gain / win / earn

The word **win** means to be #1 in a competition, or to receive an award.

- My soccer team **won** the game 3-1.
- I want to **win** the lottery!
- John **won** a prize in the science competition.

You can **win a game, win a race, win a competition,** or **win the lottery.** You can also win a medal (like in the Olympics), a prize, or an award. In conflicts, you can **win an argument**, **win a battle** or **win the war**.

The word **earn** means to get something in exchange for your work or effort.

- Sarah is a famous lawyer; she **earns** a lot of money.
- I’m not rich, but I **earn** a decent salary.
- My bank account **earns** 2% interest per month.

The word **gain** means to receive/obtain or to increase (it may or may not be the result of work or effort).

### save / keep

**Save** is used for conserving something – you can **save energy**, **save time**, or **save space.** It can also be used for rescuing, as in the expression **”save someone’s life.”** The expression **”save money”** has two meanings - to conserve money by paying less, for example: “Coupons help me save money at the supermarket.” It also means to keep money for a long time, for example: “I’m saving money for my vacation in December.” In this second case, we often say “**saving up money**.”

The word **keep** means to maintain something in your possession – for example, if someone gives you a jacket, and you try to return it, but the other person tells you to keep it. There are various other expressions using **keep** in the sense of maintaining or continuing:

- **keep trying** = continue trying
- **keep an eye on / keep track of** = continue to observe/monitor a situation
- **keep in mind** = continue being aware of something
- **keep in touch** = maintain contact with a person
- **keep something clean/safe, keep someone happy/quiet** = maintain the object or person in that state
- **keep a promise** = do the action that you promised to do
- **keep a secret** = maintain a secret hidden, not tell it to anybody

### spend / pay

You **spend** money and time:

- I **spent $100** on tickets to the baseball game.
- We **spent three hours** waiting in line to buy the tickets!

You can also **spend** a period of time like the morning, afternoon, night, weekend, week, etc.

- I **spent the weekend** making repairs to the house.
- The students **spent the afternoon** volunteering at the animal shelter.

You **pay** the request, bill, or demand for the money: **pay rent**, **pay a fine**, **pay your bills**, **pay your taxes**
It’s also possible to use **pay** with quantities of money, but we use a different preposition:

- I **spent** $100 **on** the tickets.
- I **paid** $100 **for** the tickets.
