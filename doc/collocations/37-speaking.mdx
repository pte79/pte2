## Story

Want to become a better conversationalist? Here are a few tips for **making small talk** _(talking casually about simple topics):_

- To **strike up a conversation** _(start a conversation),_ you can **make comments** about the weather or the local surroundings.

- Stay away from **delicate subjects** _(sensitive topics)_ like religion and politics – you don’t want to get into a **lengthy discussion** _(a long discussion)_ or **have an argument** _(have a verbal fight)._
- If there’s a **lull in the conversation** _(a pause in the conversation)_ ask the other person a question about themselves.

- If you **tell a story,** don’t **go on and on** _(talk too much)_ - remember that you’re having a **brief chat** _(a quick conversation)_; you’re not **making a speech**.

- Be careful about **cracking jokes** – you might end up having to **apologize profusely** _(apologize many times)_ if the person is offended.

  Having good communication skills can really improve your relationships. People appreciate it when you **get straight to the point** _(talk directly about the essential message)_ rather than **dropping hints** _(trying to communicate very indirectly)._

  Of course, nobody trusts a person who **tells lies** _(says things that aren’t true)_ or **stretches the truth** _(exaggerates and distorts the facts)._ If you always **tell the truth,** then people know they can count on you when you **give your word** _(make a promise or statement of the truth)._

  It’s also important to watch your **tone of voice** _(the emotion with which you speak)_ and avoid making **sarcastic remarks** or **disparaging comments** _(very negative and destructive comments)_. If you must **make a complaint,** try to give **constructive criticism** \_(criticism that helps the situation improve)*. And if you need to **ask a favor** of someone, always do it politely – don’t forget to say “*Please\*”!
