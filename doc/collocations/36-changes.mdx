## Story

To talk about making small changes, you can say **make adjustments, make alterations,** or **make modifications.** More informally, you can say **make tweaks** – _“We made a few tweaks to the website.”_

To talk about bigger changes, you can use the verbs “_transform_” and “_revolutionize_”:
The internet has **revolutionized the way** people communicate.
The city **transformed** the vacant lot **into** a playground. _(you usually “transform” one thing “into” something else)_.

When you put on different clothes, you **change your clothes.** When you remove a baby’s dirty diaper and put on a clean one, you **change the baby’s diaper.** When you reverse a decision or opinion, then you **change your mind.** And when you introduce a different topic of conversation, then you **change the subject.** When you change your religion, then we often use the verb convert - I **converted to Christianity;** my brother wants to **convert to Islam.**

Other verbs used for changes are _“turn,”_ _“become,”_ and “get.” Let’s look at their different collocations.

Use **turn** with colors:

- Bananas **turn black** if you put them in the refrigerator.

You can also use **turn into** as a less formal expression for “_transform into_”:

- Our living room couch **turns into** a bed.

Use **become** with emotions and states of being, including comparative adjectives:

- My sister **became angry** when she found out I’d broken her computer.
- It’s **becoming apparent/clear** that the treatment isn’t working.
- The band’s music **became popular** among teenagers.
- It’s **becoming more difficult** to separate one’s personal and professional life.

You can also use **become** with professions: My brother **became an actor.**

The word **get** can be used as a less formal alternative to “become” with emotions and comparative adjectives (but NOT with professions or states of being).

- I’m **getting excited** about my upcoming trip to Spain.

- It’s **getting more expensive** to rent a place in this neighborhood.

- Will it ever **get easier** for me to understand movies in English?

We also use the word **go** in a few specific collocations involving changes:

- **go bald** = lose your hair
- **go blind** = lose your ability to see
- **go deaf** = lose your ability to hear
- **go crazy/insane** = lose your mental control
