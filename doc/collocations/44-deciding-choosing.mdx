# 44. Deciding & Choosing

<Image src={decidingChoosingImg} alt="Deciding & Choosing" />

## Story

How do you **make a decision?** Do you make lists of **pros and cons** *(advantages and disadvantages)*and carefully **consider all the options**… or do you **trust your intuition** _(listen to your deep, instinctive feelings)_ and then **make a choice** based on your feelings?

If it’s an especially **tough decision,** you might want to **ask for advice** from a good friend. After **discussing the issue in-depth** _(talking about it in a lot of detail)_ and listening to your friend’s suggestions, you can choose to either **take their advice** *(implement their advice)*or **ignore their advice.**

When you make a decision very quickly, we call it a **snap decision.**That’s somewhat similar to a **spur-of-the-moment decision** - a decision made spontaneously, without very much thinking or planning. If you do this, then you might need to **defend your decision** against people who believe it was an **arbitrary decision** _(one determined by chance or impulse, not by logic or principle)._

Some people **remain undecided** because they’re afraid to make a **costly mistake** _(a mistake with serious negative consequences)_. In this case, **weighing the possible outcomes** _(analyzing the possible future results)_ can be helpful. Other people are always questioning themselves and **having second thoughts** _(reconsidering, doubting your previous decision)_ about the choices they’ve already made.

Although it might seem attractive to **keep your options open** as long as possible, you run the risk of waiting so long that you end up **having no choice** _(being limited to only one course of action)_. It’s far better to develop **sound judgment** _(the intelligent ability to decide things)_ so that you can make **wise decisions** _(good and smart decisions)_ and be confident about them.
