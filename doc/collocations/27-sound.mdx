## Story

Let’s begin by looking at the difference between _“sound”_ and _“noise.”_ Sometimes these words are interchangeable, but not always. A _“sound”_ can be pleasant, neutral, or unpleasant – but _“noise”_ is always either neutral or unpleasant.

- I woke up to the **lovely sound** of my wife playing the piano. _(pleasant)_
- I could hear the **soft sound** of their voices in the other room. _(neutral)_
- The fighting cats made **horrible screeching sounds**. _(unpleasant)_
- I can’t hear you; there’s a lot of **background noise.** Could you call me back? _(neutral)_
- My car is making an **annoying buzzing noise** whenever I turn on the A/C. _(unpleasant)_

If a noise or sound is very strong, we can describe it as a **loud sound/noise** – and if it is REALLY intense, then we can describe it as a **deafening sound/noise**. On the other hand, if we can barely hear it, then it is a **faint** or **soft sound/noise.** There’s also a **muffled sound** – when it seems that something is blocking the sound.

Noise that doesn’t stop is called **constant/incessant noise.** You’ll hear this type of noise if your house is close to the highway, for example – you’ll hear the **roar of traffic** day and night. If you work in a factory, then you might hear the **hum of machinery** all day long. And if you live next door to college students, you’ll probably hear **music blaring** as they party every night.

Nature is full of noises, too – such as **birds chirping** and **dogs barking.** If you sit near the ocean, you can listen to the **waves crashing.** When you’re in a remote, deserted area, you might hear the **wind whistling** through the trees. And if there’s a storm, you’ll hear the **rumble of thunder** – or be scared by a sudden thunderclap.

Now let’s talk about the absence of sound. There’s a difference between the words _“quiet”_ and _“silent.”_ _“Quiet”_ means that there is very little noise, whereas _“silent”_ means there is no noise at all.

You can emphasize the totality of the silence by saying that it was **absolutely, completely,** or **perfectly silent.** When it begins to be silent, you can say that **silence descended** or **fell,** and then when a noise interrupts the silence, it **breaks** or **shatters the silence.**

It’s also common to use collocations to give an emotional tone to the quiet/silence:

- The kids were **oddly/strangely/uncharacteristically quiet** _(the fact that it is quiet is unusual, not normal)_

- His joke about sex was followed by an **awkward/uncomfortable silence.** _(the silence is due to embarrassment)_
- After yelling at her brother, she lapsed into a **stony/sullen silence.** _(the silence is due to anger)_
- There was a **shocked/stunned silence** after the president announced his resignation. _(the silence is due to extreme surprise)_
- The city becomes **ominously/eerily quiet** after midnight. _(the quiet is frightening and possibly dangerous)_
