# Describe Image Template(DI)

There is a very interesting image in front of me, by looking loser to the given image i can see the bar chart, and this bar chart gives information about **{topic}**

According to the bar chart, **{A}** has a maximum number which is **{50%}**.

However, **{B}** has the lowest number which is **{10%}**.

These numbers increase significantly in the first period, and then they are going down dramatically in the second period.

After analyzing this bar chart, I can conclude that the numbers are going to increase (or decrease) in the future.
